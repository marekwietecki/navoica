        <h2>Pizza</h2>
        
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

        <p>In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

        <p>In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.</p>
